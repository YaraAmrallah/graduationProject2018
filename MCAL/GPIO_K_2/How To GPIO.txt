in your main.c 
#include "GPIO.h"
Add all your pins with the desired options in GPIO_Cfg.c
inside void main(){
GPIO_Init();
GPIO_SetAlternateFunction(a,b);
a= group ID ; which is the struct index located in GPIO_Cfg.c 
b= 
  0 -> use the pin as normal GPIO
  otherwise -> use the specific peripheral to the pin >note that AFSEL must be set to 1 in GPIO_Cfg.c<
  you must check the number you put according to the data sheet & pin number
GPIO_SetInterrupt_Event(c,d,e)
c= group ID
d=Interrupt event, U need to declare an instance of Interrupt event type in your main.c and input one of its values as a function parameter
e=mask status ,U need to declare an instance of GPIO_Int_maskStatus and use one of its values as a function parameter

Gpio_write(f,g)
f=group ID
g=data to write

Gpio_read(h)
h=group ID

GPIO_ClerInterruptFlag(i)
i=groupID
This is only used after MIS flag  is set (in case of polling).

GPIO_GetInterruptStatus(o,q)
this functions perform flag polling.
o= group ID
q= u need to declare a variable in your main.c and pass its address here in order to have the value of the flags back in your main code

GetPinNumber(y)
y=pinMask
Converts mask into a number.
Mask: shift amount

}
